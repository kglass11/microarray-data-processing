### Function for matching samples out of order with metadata from another file. 

# file1 is the sample list file (from your assay), file2 is the file name from your sample metadata
# input both as character vectors

# If the list for file1 is incomplete or out of order, we need to be able to match the sample metadata
# only for the samples we have run on the slides.

sample_list <- ""
metadata <- ""

function (file1, file2){
  
  #read in both files as data frames
  read.csv()
  
  merge()
}
