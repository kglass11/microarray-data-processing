###Combined script for reading in and processing microarray data to prepare for analysis
  #Last updated May 23, 2018, KG

###Create a folder, into which you should copy this script, your .gpr files (named 'Slide 1.gpr', 'Slide 2.gpr' etc.), 
# and your sample list, sample metadata, and target (antigen) metadata csv files.

# Your sample list file needs six columns. Their names must be exactly as written here, though the order of the samples does not matter:
#1.slide_no
#2.sample_id
#3.block_rep_1
#4.block_rep_2
#5.exclude - where samples you want to exclude are labeled "yes"
#6.sample_type - where samples are labeled as "test" or "control"

# In your target metadata file, the targets must be listed in the same order as they are in the .gpr files. 
# If you have two identical blocks printed (for duplicates), only list block 1 in your target metadata file. 

###Clear the environnment - OR go to Session > Clear Workspace
rm(list=ls())

###Install any packages you may need for this script. Go to Tools, install packages, 
#then install from CRAN repository or local file or run:
#install.packages(c("dplyr","gtools","contrast", "beeswarm", "mixtools", "gplots", "ggplot2", "gcookbook", "reshape2"))

##Install limma if you haven't already
## try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
#source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
#biocLite("limma")

###Load packages needed for this script
require("gtools")

library(limma)
library(contrast)
library(beeswarm)
library(mixtools)
library(gplots)
library(ggplot2)
library(gcookbook)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

### Define variables based on your study that will be used later in the script
# define working directory character vector, example "I:/Drakeley Group/Protein microarrays/Experiments/030417 Ghanaian samples/RepeatProcessingMay21KG"
workdir <- "/Users/Katie/Desktop/R files from work/GhanaProcessingMay21KG"

# define a shorthand name for your study which will be appended in the file name of all exported files
study <- "Ghana.v2"

#define file name for sample IDs character vector, example "Analysis sample list 2.csv"
sample_file <- "Sample list.csv"

#define file name for sample file + additional metadata (character vector)
meta_file <- "Sample metadata.csv"

#define file name for antigen list file with additional info about targets.
target_file <- "Target metadata with Tags.csv" 

#number of technical replicates for the study (usually 1 or 2)
reps <- 2

#define number of blocks per slide
index_block <- 32

### Set the working directory for the folder where .gpr files are. Can check working
#directory after with getwd()
setwd(workdir)
getwd()

###READING IN YOUR MICROARRAY DATA###
#####################################

###Identify all .gpr files in your set path. default path for list.files() is the working directory.
slide_ids <- list.files(pattern="*.gpr")

###Read in the contents of each of the .gpr files you just identified
#This simply combines the data in a list format
#If your gpr files differ in terms of the number of rows of information before the header, you need to edit this command
#i.e skip=34 means it will skip the first 34 rows, and header=T means it will read the 35th ow as a header, and the 36th as the first row of data
# which is what currently happens in our GPR files.
#Note: slide_no_temp should be the last slide added to the list
#Slide number is assigned based on the file name. As files are created without editing by the genepix software - this seems like the easiest way of identifying files.
slides_list <- list()
for(i in 1:length(slide_ids)) { 
  
  slides_list[[i]] <- read.table(slide_ids[i],skip=34,sep="\t",header=T)
  slide_no_temp <- substr(slide_ids[[i]],7,nchar(slide_ids[[i]])-4)
  slides_list[[i]][,"slide_no"] <- slide_no_temp
}
remove(i)

###Name your slides in this list, according to their file names
names(slides_list) <- slide_ids

###Bind all data from the slide data list (slides.list) into a single dataframe
#you may get a warning after this step, invalid factor level, this is not a problem!
slides_all.df <- c()
for(i in 1:length(slides_list)) { 
  
  slides_all.df <- rbind(slides_all.df,slides_list[[i]])
}
remove(i)

###Read in list of sample IDs
samples.df <- read.csv(sample_file, header=T, na.strings = " ", check.names = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

###Read in sample metadata file
sample_meta1.df <- read.csv(meta_file, header=T, na.strings = " ", check.names = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

###Read in target metadata file
target_meta.df <- read.csv(target_file, header=T, na.strings = " ", check.names = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

###Processing sample list:
###Create a vector listing all of your samples, in the order they appear in your samples_list file
#In our samples_list files, the sample ID is always in column two - which is why that column is picked out here
samples <- as.character(samples.df[1:nrow(samples.df), 2])

###Now, make a new sample variable that is unique (to avoid issues with multiple blanks, etc.) 
 # Add this column at the end of the sample list file, not at a prespecified column number
samples.df$sample_id_unique <- c()
samples_unique <- c(paste(as.character(samples.df[1:nrow(samples.df), 2]), rownames(samples.df), sep = "_"))
samples.df$sample_id_unique <- samples_unique

### Cleaning sample metadata (epi data)
#Remove one of the duplicates where the whole row is duplicated (i.e. same thing listed twice)
sample_meta2.df <- distinct(sample_meta1.df)

#Export a table of duplicate entries that do not match (i.e. there is a problem with epi data) 
duplicate_metadata <- sample_meta2.df[(duplicated(sample_meta2.df$sample_id)| duplicated(sample_meta2.df$sample_id, fromLast=TRUE)),]
write.csv(duplicate_metadata, file = paste0(study, "_duplicate_metadata.csv"))

#Remove duplicate entries automatically (both duplicates)
sample_meta3.df <- sample_meta2.df[!(duplicated(sample_meta2.df$sample_id) | duplicated(sample_meta2.df$sample_id, fromLast=TRUE)),]

#Set exclude = "yes" in sample list file for duplicates that don't match in metadata
dup <- unique(duplicate_metadata$sample_id)
for(i in 1:length(dup)){
  samples.df$exclude[which(samples.df$sample_id == dup[i])] <- "yes"
}
remove(i)

### Merge the sample list file and the sample metadata file to include the appropriate metadata
#The duplicate metadata will now be listed as NA, with exclude = yes

sample_meta.df <- merge(samples.df, sample_meta3.df, by = "sample_id", all.x = TRUE)

###Create vectors indicating the number of slides, blocks, and samples
#Slide and sample number are determined automatically from the data you input, whereas block number is manual in this instance
index_slide <- as.numeric(length(slides_list))
index_sample <- as.numeric(length(samples))

###Assign your sample_ids to each row of the combined slide data (slides_all.df)
#The order of data in your samples.df file is irrelevant, as long as each sample ID is correctly matched to its slide and block numbers

for(i in 1:dim(slides_all.df)[1]){
  
  print(i)
  row_ite<-slides_all.df[i,]
  block_ite<-row_ite$Block
  slide_ite<-row_ite$slide_no
  sample_info_1<-samples.df[which(samples.df$slide_no==slide_ite),]
  match<-block_ite%in%sample_info_1[,"block_rep_1"]
  if(match==TRUE){
    value<-which(block_ite==sample_info_1[,"block_rep_1"])
  }else{
    value<-which(block_ite==sample_info_1[,"block_rep_2"])
  }
  sample_info_2<-sample_info_1[value,"sample_id_unique"]
  slides_all.df$Sample[i]<-as.character(sample_info_2)
}
remove(i, sample_info_1, sample_info_2, match, row_ite, block_ite, slide_ite)

###Write slides_all.df to a file to keep as a csv in your directory
write.csv(slides_all.df,file=paste0(study,"_slidesall_combinedGPR.csv"), row.names=T)

###Save slides_all.df as an R object to be loaded later so that you don't have to redo that part
save(slides_all.df, file=paste0(study,"_slides_all.df"))
     
#If you are going to load slides_all.df to save time, run in the command line:
#load(paste0(study,"_slides_all.df"))

### Make a spot annotations dataframe
annotation_targets.df <- filter(slides_all.df, slide_no==1, Block == 1 | Block == 2)
annotation_targets.df <- annotation_targets.df[,1:4]

annotation_targets.df <- cbind(row.names(annotation_targets.df), annotation_targets.df)
colnames(annotation_targets.df)[1] <- "target_id_numeric"
annotation_targets.df[6] <- c(paste(rownames(annotation_targets.df), annotation_targets.df$Name, annotation_targets.df$Block, sep = "_"))
colnames(annotation_targets.df)[6] <- "target_id_unique"
rownames(annotation_targets.df) <- c(annotation_targets.df$target_id_unique)

###Make a final index, this time of targets
index_target <- as.numeric(length(annotation_targets.df$target_id_numeric))

###SELECT RELEVANT DATA###

###Generate specific data frames e.g. median foreground and background
#The column identifying the sample_id in slides_all.df id column 42
#The column identifying the foreground median in slides_all.df is 9
#The column identifying the background median in slides_all.df is 14
#The column identifying the median.df - the background in slides_all.df is 34 (here we ignore this column)

#Foreground
fore.df <- annotation_targets.df
for(i in 1:length(samples)){
  ite_out<-slides_all.df[which(slides_all.df[,42]==samples_unique[i]),9]
  fore.df<-cbind(fore.df,ite_out)
  colnames(fore.df)[length(colnames(fore.df))]<-samples_unique[i]
}

#Background
back.df <- annotation_targets.df
for(i in 1:length(samples)){
  ite_out<-slides_all.df[which(slides_all.df[,42]==samples_unique[i]),14]
  back.df<-cbind(back.df,ite_out)
  colnames(back.df)[length(colnames(back.df))]<-samples_unique[i]
}

#Generate matrices of the same data (that is, the same data with only a single data type)
fore.matrix <- as.matrix(fore.df[,7:ncol(fore.df)])
back.matrix <- as.matrix(back.df[,7:ncol(back.df)])

###DATA CORRECTION###

### Perform background correction using limma function and normexp method.
cor.matrix <- backgroundCorrect.matrix(fore.matrix, back.matrix, method = "normexp", offset = 50, normexp.method = "mle")

#Export this for reference
write.csv(cor.matrix, file=paste0(study,"_background_corrected_MFI.csv"))

###Assign target names to groups of your array targets to identify their 'type'
targets_blank = c(grep("BLANK", annotation_targets.df$Name))
targets_buffer = c(grep("buffer", annotation_targets.df$Name))
targets_ref = c(grep("REF", annotation_targets.df$Name))
targets_std = c(grep("Std", annotation_targets.df$Name))
targets_allcontrol = c(targets_blank, targets_buffer, targets_ref, targets_std)

###Remove "bad" spots from subsequent analysis

#First, we need to tell R which spots are the highest spots on the plate
#the spots printed immediately after these can be made to have null MFIs
#This call will create a vector identifying all ref spots, plus all std spots called "Std 1"
high_targets <- c(targets_ref, grep("Std 1", row.names(annotation_targets.df)))
high_targets_disinclude <-c()

#subset high_targets to exclude high targets in the bottom of block 1
#these were printed last in both cases (reps = 1 or reps = 2)
high_targets1 <- high_targets[!between(high_targets, (index_target/2 - 12), (index_target/2))]

#To identify the spots to disinclude, we need to identify the position of the next spot in the print run.
#This is different for reps=1 or reps=2.

# For singlicate printing, the printer prints from top to bottom, right to left, with a new pickup for block 1 with different 
#targets than were just printed in block 2. 

if (reps==1){
  # If the high target is in block 2, then exclude high_target - index_target/2 
  # If the high target is in block 1, then exclude high_target + index_target/2 + 12
  high_targets_disinclude <- ifelse(high_targets1>=index_target/2, high_targets1-(index_target/2), high_targets1+(index_target/2+12))
}

# For duplicate printing, the printer prints from top to bottom, right to left, with only one pickup for both duplicate rows

if (reps==2){
  
  #subset high_targets1 to exclude high targets within (index target - 12) because these were printed last.
  high_targets2 <- high_targets1[!between(high_targets1,(index_target - 12), index_target)]
  
  #for either block 1 or block 2, exclude high target + 12
  for (i in 1:length(high_targets2)){
  high_targets_disinclude[i] <- high_targets2[i] + 12
  }
  high_targets_disinclude <- subset(high_targets_disinclude, !is.na(high_targets_disinclude))
}
remove(i)

###Convert the spots to be disincluded to NAs in background corrected data
cor2.matrix <- cor.matrix
cor2.matrix[high_targets_disinclude, ] <- NA

###QUALITY CONTROL###

### 1. Background
#To identify which slides, pads, and samples are significantly deviated, we need to calculate the mean and generate an arbitrary cut off 
#The cut off can be used to flag samples, and tells us whether deviation is universal, or specific to slides, pads, or samples
#We are not automatically excluding samples with deviant background, but it might be a good idea to
# go back and review the images for those pads.

#Mean of median background MFI for all data points

### 2. Buffer
#Though some slides/pads may have high background, background correction may adjust this and make the data useable.
#The only way of identifying if this is true is by looking at the control spots by slide and pad.
#If the same samples have high controls, the background correction was not enough.
#Correction against plate buffers may be required...

#The cut off can be used to flag samples, and tells us whether deviation is universal, or specific to slides, pads, or samples
